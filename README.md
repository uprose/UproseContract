# Uprose

Uprose Contract is an open source blockchain project, designed for decentralized exchange from the start. Uprose allows you to build interoperable blockchain networks. Uprose smart contract allows you to create your own blockchain token and also to create tether tokens for other crypto currencies, Forex, Commodities, Stocks and Cryptocurrencies.

## **Features**

- Cross-asset trading platform - Smart blockchain based cross-asset trading platform for Forex, Commodities, Stocks and Cryptocurrencies
- Decentralization - No single point of control. No single point of failure. Decentralized control via a federation of voting nodes makes for a P2P network.
- Immutability - More than just tamper-resistant. Once stored, data can&#39;t be changed or deleted.
- Byzantine Fault Tolerant - Up to one third of the nodes in the network can be experiencing arbitrary faults and the rest of the network will still come to consensus on the next block.
- Open Source - Open sourced to the community so that everyone can use it and build their own applications on top of it.
- Query - Write and run any MongoDB query to search the contents of all stored transactions, assets, metadata and blocks. Powered by MongoDB itself.
- Low Latency - A global network takes about a second to come to consensus on a new block. In other words, transaction finality happens fast.
- Public or Private - Roll out your own public or private networks for specific industry use cases.
